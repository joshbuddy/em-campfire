## How to contribute

Here's the most direct way to get your work merged into the project:

1. Fork the project
2. Clone down your fork
3. Create a feature branch
4. Add your feature + tests
5. Document new features in the README
6. Make sure everything still passes by running the tests
7. If necessary, rebase your commits into logical chunks, without errors
8. Push the branch up
9. Send a pull request for your branch

# What to contribute?

See the github issues or the TODO section in the README for some features to work on

# Coverage

When you run the tests a coverage report is made. We're not aiming for 100% coverage, it's just a guide.

Take a look at the TODO list or known issues for some inspiration if you need it.
